WELCOME to the Notebook App
This is a demo project by David Scott Blackburn, you can see his latest published

RUNNING THE APP
Go to www.dsbburn.com
You will need to SIGN UP with an email and password.  The app is a simple 
Note/Notebook application.

The purpose of this app is to showcase my ability to create ASP.NET MVC 5 application, 
my general programming ability, and my written communication skills.

To fully understand the thoughts that went into creating this site, please review the 
From The Programmer's Cubical blog on my linked in account.  If you wish to see
analysis/design documents, such as Use Case, State Diagrams, Class diagrams, etc. Please
let me know, and I will send you those documents.

One of the the things to keep in mind is the over all design principle I used was 
KISS (Keep it Simple).  However, the Model has a more sophisicated design, in order
to demonstrate that I use good programming priciples that include expandablity, and
enabling full unit testing.  

A unit tester project was created to demostrate that I am able to utilize this
technology.

Identity was used to control system access because it is a standard.  Not much was
changed with this system except the mentioning of external/two login authintication
was removed.  In a normal application these facilities would be used.

This project was designed as it was so that it can be expanded.  If you as a 
potential employer wishes to see a demonstration of my programming abilities, please
request a change to the system.

Finally I will be making changes to this application in order to improve and expand it. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this.  Please use the LinkedIn information in
